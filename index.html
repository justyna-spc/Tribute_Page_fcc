    <h3>Diana is a powerful, strong-willed character who does not back down from a fight or a challenge. Yet, she is a diplomat who strongly "favors the pen", and a lover of peace who would never seek to fight or escalate a conflict. She's simultaneously both the most fierce and most nurturing member of the Justice League; and her political connections as a United Nations Honorary Ambassador and the ambassador of a warrior nation makes her an invaluable addition to the team. With her powerful abilities, centuries of training and experience at handling threats that range from petty crime to threats that are of a magical or supernatural nature, Diana is capable of competing with nearly any hero or villain.</h3>
    
    <ul><h3>Powers</h3>
      <li><strong>Superhuman Strength</strong> - Superhuman strength was one of the gifts from the goddess Demeter. As a result of Demeter's blessing, Wonder Woman was as strong as earth (of which Demeter is the patron saint).</li>
      <li><strong>Superhuman Condition</strong> - Wonder Woman is capable of strenuous physical exertion beyond human capabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Superhuman Endurance</strong> - Another of Demeter's gifts. Diana has a high resistance to almost all forms of bodily harm, ailments and magical attacks, although she is not indestructible.</li>
      <li><strong>Superhuman speed and reflexes</strong> - Wonder Woman owes her superhuman speed to the divine messenger - Hermes. Thanks to her superhuman reflexes, Diana is able to quickly cover herself in case of danger, with hands equipped with indestructible bracelets.</li>
      <li><strong>Flying</strong> - The ability to fly active very fast is another gift from Hermes.</li>
      <li><strong>Regenerative abilities</strong> - In the event of any wounds, Diana's body is able to regenerate very quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Heightened Senses</strong> - Heightened senses of sight, smell, and hearing were a gift from the god of the hunt, Artemis.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication with animals</strong> - another power given by Artemis. It allows to establish a bond with any animal in order to, for example, calm them down.</li>
      <li><strong>Superhuman Intellect</strong> - Wonder Woman's immense intelligence and wisdom is a gift from Athena.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul><h3>Training</h3>
      <li><strong>Hand-to-hand combat</strong> - Wonder Woman is one of the best fighters to be born from among the Amazons. Diana is proficient in both bare-knuckle combat, fencing, or any other cutting or throwing weapon (especially throwing her tiara returning like a boomerang), as well as archery.</li>
      <li><strong>Pilotage</strong> - Diana is a great pilot. She easily flies her invisible plane.</li>
      <li><strong>Beauty</strong> - Diana's extraordinary beauty was a gift from Aphrodite.</li>
        <li><strong>Multilingualism</strong> - Diana speaks multiple languages.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul><h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>All equipment is the work of Hephaestus.</p>
      <li><strong>Lasso of truth</strong> - a magic lasso that forces to tell the truth on a tied one (reference to polygraph) Forged from Gaia's golden belt, the lasso was a gift from the goddess Hestia. Wonder Woman uses it to capture enemies and interrogate them.</li>
      <li><strong>Victory Bracelets</strong> - A pair of bulletproof bracelets. They were forged from the shield of Athena - Aegis. Their use is related to the superhuman strength, speed and agility of the Amazon. Bracelets are able to deflect any weapon thrown like arrows, revolver, pistol or rifle ammunition and all kinds of energy attacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Tiara</strong> - Diana's golden tiara (actually a diadem) can be used as a throwing weapon. Thrown back like a boomerang. Its sharp edges can be used for cutting.</li>
      <li><strong>Gaia's Golden Belt</strong> - Amazonian insignia, donated to Hippolytus and Antiope by the Olympic gods. They were made of the original belt belonging to Gaia (from it a lasso of truth was made). They have the power to increase strength and skill.</li>
      <li><strong>Kanga</strong> - a species of giant kangaroos that inhabit Paradise Island and serve the Amazons as mounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Invisible plane</strong> - the invisible plane is the main means of transport of the protagonist. It is able to transform into any other vehicle, depending on the need: from a submarine to a chariot flying in space. The plane can be remotely controll by telepathy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>"I used to want to save the world. To end war and bring peace to mankind. But then I glimpsed the darkness that lives within their light. I learnt that inside every one of them there will always be both. The choice each must make for themselvesâ€”something no hero will ever defeat."</p>
